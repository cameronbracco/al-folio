As an aside, when I was in high school I discovered [Recommend Me a Book](https://recommendmeabook.com/). The site allows you to read the first page of a random book without knowing any of the details about it. It's like being instantly, yet briefly, transported into a new world. I'm glad to see that it is still around--it's a wonderful starting point for your curiosity.
