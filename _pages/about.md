Heyo! Welcome to my personal website/portfolio. Here you'll find some information about my [previous projects](/projects), my [teaching experience](/teaching), as well as a [blog](blog) for things I find interesting.

I'm currently a third year computer science student at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu) with a passion for space, robotics, additive manufacturing, and the constantly evasive idea of memory. I also love teaching and helping people learn, and I am lucky to work part-time as a Teaching Assistant for our Fundamentals of Computer Science class.

Whenever I'm not in classes or teaching you'll likely find me working on projects as part of [AerospaceNU](https://aerospacenu.com). I am extremely lucky to have served as the club's President since Fall 2020, and as VP for a year before that. As part of my role I get to interact with over 150 incredibly tralented students who come together from all over the university to work on student-led aerospace projects. My main goal as President is to build a community that will enable the club to continue existing and providing experiences to students for years to come--I hope to set the stage for the next generation of eager and curious students.

**I'm currently looking for a company at which to complete my second co-op during Summer/Fall 2021. I would love to work somewhere that is actively tackling the challenges of space exploration (ideally human!) and is looking for a Computer Scientist with a knack for solving hard problems and seeing the big picture. If you work at such a place, or would like to make an introduction, [let me know](mailto:cameronbracco@gmail.com).**
