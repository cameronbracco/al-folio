Heyo! Welcome to my personal website/portfolio. Here you'll find some information about my [previous projects](/projects), my [teaching experience](/teaching), as well as a [blog](blog) for things I find interesting.

I'm currently a third year computer science student at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu) with a passion for space, robotics, additive manufacturing, and the constantly evasive idea of memory. I also love teaching and helping people learn, and I'm very interested in how we can provide high-quality, public education at both the primary and secondary levels.

Whenever I'm not in classes or teaching you'll likely find me working on projects as part of [AerospaceNU](https://aerospacenu.com). I am extremely lucky to have served as the club's President since Fall 2020, and as VP for a year before that. As part of my role I get to interact with over 150 incredibly tralented students who come together from all over the university to work on student-led aerospace projects. My main goal as President is to build a community that will enable the club to continue existing and providing experiences to students for years to come--I hope to set the stage for the next generation of eager and curious students.

In Fall 2021 I'll be joining [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/) for an Avionics internship. If you'll be in the Seattle area I'd love to meet up!

I'm always looking for future opportunities. I would love to work somewhere that is either actively tackling the challenges of space exploration (ideally human!), exploring new modes of education, or conducting interesting research work at the intersection of computer science and memory. If you work at such a place or have something else you think I might be interested in, [let me know](mailto:cameronbracco@gmail.com)!s
