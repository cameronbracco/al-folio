Ever since my second semester I have served as a Teaching Assistant in the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). My teaching experience has been focused on our Fundamentals of Computer Science curriculum (aka “Fundies”) which spans students first and second semesters. The entire purpose of this curriculum is to [develop developers](develop developers) and to teach them a design recipe and a systematic way of solving problems of any size and complexity.

This process can certainly feel unnatural at first–I know I felt so. I came into Northeastern with significant exposure to CS, but despite that experience from the very first day I was forced to rethink my approach to solving problems. After having gone through the process I can certainly say that I am better off for it. My goal when teaching this curriculum now is to be an approachable and relatable figure that makes that process just a little bit easier.

It is my favorite thing in the world to hear a student say that I helped them learn something, and I am incredibly proud of my [student feedback](http://cameronbracco.com/assets/pdf/fall2020_student_feedback.pdf) from Fall 2020.
